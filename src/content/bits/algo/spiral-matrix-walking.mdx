Recently, I’ve started to be active at solving LeetCode problems.
For those how isn’t aware of the LeetCode platform,
the platform provides a training environment
with a wide range of algorithmic problems to improve problem-solving skills.

As I’ve just started blowing away dust from my algorithmic skills, I go through a range of classic problems.
One such classic, yet interesting, problem is spiral matrix traversal.

## The statement

You're given a two-dimensional matrix. Starting at the `(0,0)` you need to traverse all elements of the matrix in spiral order (clockwise).

##

### First step

Let's define our directions first. Looking at the example:

-- TODO: example

we need to move in four direcations: to the right, down, to the left and up.

Let's define our current position in the matrix as `(r, c)`, where `r` is the current row and `c` is the current column we are at.
Starting at `(r, c)` to go to the next element on the right, i.e. at the `(r, c+1)` we need to increment our position by `(0, 1)`.
Similar, to get the immediate element below, we need to increment by `(1, 0)`.

Fast-forward, here is the table of all deltas to move in all 4 directions:

| Right  | Down   | Left    | Up      |
| ------ | ------ | ------- | ------- |
| (0, 1) | (1, 0) | (0, -1) | (-1, 0) |

Let's define our boundaries on the first step.

We are starting at the position `(0, 0)` and going to the top-rightmost element `(m-1, 0)` of the matrix. To get there, we need to incrementally go through all
preceding `m-1` elements, until we reach the top-rightmost one.
